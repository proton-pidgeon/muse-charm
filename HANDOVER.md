# HANDOVER.md — muse-charm

## 2026-10-03 — repo created, simulator task dispatched
- Repo `proton-pidgeon/muse-charm` (public) created for the DIY Muse Charm
  project. Starting point: get Meta's UI simulator running before buying
  hardware.
- `docs/simulator-setup.md` written from upstream
  `esp32/simulator/README.md` (muse-gadget-sdk @ 2026-10-03).
- `tasks/01-build-and-verify-simulator.md` dispatched to headless Claude on
  mac-daddy31337 via `/implement`.
- Next: review screenshots, run the interactive smoke test locally, then
  pick hardware (BOX-3B vs Waveshare 1.75C vs AiPi Lite — see research).

## 2026-10-03 — task 01 done: simulator builds, tests green, 5 renders
- **SDK commit built:** `facebookincubator/muse-gadget-sdk@b1a3822`
  ("Add M5Stack Cardputer ADV support (#10)"), shallow clone at
  `~/builds/muse-charm/scratch/muse-gadget-sdk` (outside this repo,
  unmodified). Build dir `esp32/simulator/build` there.
- Toolchain: cmake 4.4.3 + ninja 1.13.2 (brew-installed this session),
  AppleClang 17, Python 3.14.6. Clean Debug build, 541 steps, 0 warnings.
  CMake chose the downloaded/bundled `SDL2::SDL2` + `lvgl::lvgl`.
- `ctest`: 1/1 passed (`muse_simulator_headless`, ~1 s).
- **Screenshots** (412x412 P6 PPM, ~509 KB each, all distinct; PNG copies
  alongside for quick viewing): `~/builds/muse-charm/renders/`
  `{idle,listening,thinking,speaking,happy}.ppm` (+ `.png`).
  idle/listening/thinking used upstream scenarios; speaking + happy used
  scenario files written to `~/builds/muse-charm/renders/scenarios/`.
- **Doc corrections** (applied to `docs/simulator-setup.md`):
  1. Upstream ships only `error/idle/listening/pairing/thinking` scenarios;
     there is no `speaking.txt` or `happy.txt`; write your own (`face=` accepts
     `speaking` and `happy`).
  2. On this Mac the first configure failed: "C compiler is not able to compile a
     simple test program", `ld: tapi error ... unknown architecture
     arm64e.x1-macos`. Cause: `xcode-select` → Xcode 26.2 (ld-1230) but
     clang's default SDK is the newer CLT `MacOSX27.0.sdk`. Workaround used:
     `export SDKROOT=$(xcrun --sdk macosx --show-sdk-path)` (Xcode's 26.2 SDK)
     before configuring. Real fix: update Xcode to 27 or
     `sudo xcode-select -s /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools`.
  3. `--help` matches the doc; scenario keys also include `battery_mv`,
     `usb`, `charging`, `asleep`, `passkey`, `paired`, `speaker`,
     `brightness`, `level`. Unset keys get defaults (e.g. battery shows 72%).
- Next: human runs the interactive smoke test, then pick hardware.

## 2026-10-03 — task 02 scoped: live transport hack
- Code-reading verdict: typed-chat hack is feasible (clean `muse_hatch_*`
  seam; portable in-repo Noise+mbedTLS; `muse_state_set_caption` for
  replies). Voice is a separate, bigger task.
- Auth wall, tested: SDK token (`mgst_...`) → `fetch_vms` → 401. A device
  token (from app+BLE pairing of a real board) is required. Temp token
  material destroyed after the test.
- `tasks/02-sim-live-transport.md` written; token is runtime config only
  (env var or ~/.muse-charm/token), never in the repo.
